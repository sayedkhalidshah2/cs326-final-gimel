Innovative Idea
---
Our idea is to create a centralized site such that both the students and staff who go to student run buisness have an easy and efficient way to see menu's, operating times, contact information, etc. The idea came from the lack of any truly convenient sites for student run buisnesses like the ones that exist for the Dining Halls. We are basing the idea of final project off of the current [UMass Dining](https://umassdining.com/) website that many students use in order to know what meals are going to be offered at the dining hall of their choosing. While the students have an easy way to "see" the buisnesses dining information (such as Roots,Sylvan Snack Bar, Greenos and the rest), the students who work in the buisness will have an easy way to edit the information in real time for customers to see. 

 Important Components:
---
Functions provided by the application will be as follows: User authentification in order to distinguish between staff and customers. The ability for staff to alter menu components (items, descriptions, prices and contact information), hours of operation and important notices or messages for customers. These will be easily accesible for the staff in order for them to efficiently alter the site without any kind of web development experience. This also means that ther will exist a "log in/log out" functionality for the staff to use, only staff will have the credentials needed for this function.
