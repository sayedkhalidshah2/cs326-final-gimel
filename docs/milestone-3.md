Important Note:

Our team had use the last milestone in order to set up and connect to our mongo-db databse rather than use random data returns. Our team had instead taken this time to fully integrate and refine our front end site so that it worked dynamically with our database. Our division of labor is going to be the same as it was for the previous milestone with the addition of the work done during our current milestone. Another important note is that our front end will be changing between this milestone and the next as we will be refining and wapping our current front end with a more clean and user-friendly front end. 

Work Distribution:

Sayed: Worked on frontend refinement and documentation, contributions also in routing and database edits

Veronica: Worked on database and front end refinement as well as server debugging, contributions also in routing

Josh: Worked on routing and frontend refinement, contributions also in database edits


<!-- In this milestone, we made a swap at our front end. Veronica came up with a clean and easy to use front end. We liked that better than what we originally had. We also agreed on using it during our prsentation and that's why we had to make this change. This front-end also interated better with the back-end in rendering the data.  -->
